    <h2>What is a "solidarity kitchen"?</h2>
    
    <p>It takes a network! We at Tacoma Kind Rides envision a small network of kitchens that can supply batches of breakfast burritos for distribution on the last Saturday of the month. At our homebase kitchen we can typically produce 100 burritos -- give or take. With a network of even just 2 - 3 kitchens we imagine we could easily, double or even triple that capacity.</p>

    <h3>What do I need to be a TKR Solidarity Kitchen?</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The ability to make and prep for distrubution at least 25 - 50 breakfast buritos on the last Saturday of a given month.</li>
        <li>The desire to make great tasing, hot burritos for your neighbors in need.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Solidarity Kitchen FAQ</h2>
    <p>Do I need to provide the ingredients and other supplies for making the burritos myself?</p>
    <ul>
        <li>No, but...if you are able and willing to procure the supplies needed, we'd welcome that donation of resources. However, if you are able to cook in your kitchen, we are happy to supply you with necessary ingredients for burrito making. See the <a href="how-to.html" target="_blank">"How-To Kind Ride" Resources Page</a> for more info on food prep and distribution.</li>
    </ul>
