# Mission/Vision

Tacoma Kind Rides (TKR) believes that everyone deserves the dignity of a warm meal and we, as Tacomans, have an obligatioon to be kind to our unhoused neighbors. On the last Saturday of the of every month -- we prepare breakfast burritos and hit the streets on our bikes. 

Founded in 2020 by Abraham Ojeda as a bike outreach designed to provide food during the Thnaksgiving and Christmas holidays, a small group of deicated volunteers have since formalized Tacoma Kind Rides into monthly happening that seeks to not only distribute a hot meal, but also hygiene and harm reduction kits to help with basic needs. 

It's a small way to show kindness and build community. 

# Why we do what we do

Grounded in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, we know that in order for anybody to feel secure, their basic physiological and safety needs must first be met. Our outreach is designed to provide our unhoused neighbors with a hot meal and essential items, such as hygiene products, to ensure these foundational needs are addressed. By meeting these immediate needs, we create a supportive environment where individuals can begin to focus on feeling safe, building relationships, belonging in our community, and ultimately persuing personal growth and fulfillment.

    too soupy.(Transfer and keep warm in chafing dish.)

    taste. Winco brand is pretty good.(Transfer and keep warm in chafing
    dish.)

BE A TKR SOLIDARITY KITCHEN
---------------------------

![Prepping burritos.](images/burrito-prep.png){width="572" height="428"}

What is a \"solidarity kitchen\"?
---------------------------------

It takes a network! We at Tacoma Kind Rides envision a small network of
kitchens that can supply batches of breakfast burritos for distribution
on the last Saturday of the month. At our homebase kitchen we can
typically produce 100 burritos \-- give or take. With a network of even
just 2 - 3 kitchens we imagine we could easily, double or even triple
that capacity.

### What do I need to be a TKR Solidarity Kitchen?

-   The ability to make and prep for distrubution at least 25 - 50
    breakfast buritos on the last Saturday of a given month.
-   The desire to make great tasing, hot burritos for your neighbors in
    need.

A Solidarity Kitchen FAQ
------------------------

Do I need to provide the ingredients and other supplies for making the
burritos myself?

-   No, but\...if you are able and willing to procure the supplies
    needed, we\'d welcome that donation of resources. However, if you
    are able to cook in your kitchen, we are happy to supply you with
    necessary ingredients for burrito making. See the [\"How-To Kind
    Ride\" Resources Page](how-to.html) for more info on food prep and
    distribution.
