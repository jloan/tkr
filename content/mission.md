# Mission/Vision

Tacoma Kind Rides (TKR) believes that everyone deserves the dignity of a warm meal and we, as Tacomans, have an obligatioon to be kind to our unhoused neighbors. On the last Saturday of the of every month -- we prepare breakfast burritos and hit the streets on our bikes. 

Founded in 2020 by Abraham Ojeda as a bike outreach designed to provide food during the Thnaksgiving and Christmas holidays, a small group of deicated volunteers have since formalized Tacoma Kind Rides into monthly happening that seeks to not only distribute a hot meal, but also hygiene and harm reduction kits to help with basic needs. 

It's a small way to show kindness and build community. 

# Why we do what we do

Grounded in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs, we know that in order for anybody to feel secure, their basic physiological and safety needs must first be met. Our outreach is designed to provide our unhoused neighbors with a hot meal and essential items, such as hygiene products, to ensure these foundational needs are addressed. By meeting these immediate needs, we create a supportive environment where individuals can begin to focus on feeling safe, building relationships, belonging in our community, and ultimately persuing personal growth and fulfillment.
